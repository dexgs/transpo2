# Custom CSS rules

Place files in here to apply their contents after the default stylesheets.
For example, if you place a file called `styles.css` in this directory, it will
be loaded after the `styles.css` file in the parent directory, overriding any
overlapping CSS rules.

You can use this to apply custom styles to your instance of Transpo.
