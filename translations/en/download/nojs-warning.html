This means decryption will be handled on the server
instead of in your browser. The key to decrypt the
download will only be stored by the server for the
duration of the decryption process, but be aware
that this is <b>less secure</b> than decrypting in
your browser which requires JavaScript.

If you wish to proceed anyway, copy the decryption
key from the address bar into the "Decryption key"
field. The key is the segment of the URL which comes
<b>AFTER</b> the <code>#</code> symbol.
